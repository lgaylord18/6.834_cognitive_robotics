    "The input to RRT algorithm is the configuration of initial state. The algorithm outputs the tree that starts from the initial configuration and spans out over the given configuration space. RRT algorithm iterates for number of total nodes of trees which is specified by users. Starting from the initial tree with only initial configuration, RRT incrementally expands the tree in every iteration. In each iteration, a new configuration is sampled randomly. Then, RRT finds a node (configuration) in the existing tree that is nearest to the newly sampled configuration. Here, the metric for determining what the nearest node depends on the application. In many cases, Euclidean distance is used for convenience. After nearest configuration is selected, RRT tries to connect to the newly sampled node from the nearest configuration. Here, connection doesn’t have to meet the newly sampled node exactly since the new node is going to be connected to the tree as leaf of the tree. This is why RRT is suitable for handling underactuated dynamical systems (for underactuated dynamical systems, finding trajectory that connects given two points exactly, called Two Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP), is a nontrivial problem). After expansion, we add the edge and the resulting end configuration from the connection to the existing tree and start a new iteration."

It finds the set of LQR control policies that guides the initial configuration to any other configurations in the configuration space. If the given dynamical system can be stably steered to an objective configuration using the LQR control policy (this can be proved using Lyapunov stability analysis for a given dynamics), this means we can steer the dynamical system to a vicinity of the objective configuration (This was checked in the above code). If the system is linear, we only need one LQR control policy centered around the objective configuration. If, however, the system dynamics is nonlinear, we might need a sequence of LQR control policies centered around a sequence of configuration nodes to steer the system to the objective configuration. If the tree is dense enough and the system can be locally stabilized around each linearized points in the configuration with LQR control policy, then we can make the system converge to the objective configuration in the end by following a sequence of LQR control policy. You can think of this as following a sequence of funnels to get to the objective configuration."
