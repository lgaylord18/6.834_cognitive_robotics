# underactuated-robotics-ws

## Planned Usage

Our team has been working closely with the SLAM and multi-agent path planning I teams to control the robot for the initial map exploration phase of the challenge. Our code takes the published map from SLAM and waypoints from MAPP1 (by calling a service provided by that team) and publishes short-horizon waypoints to the move_base package. We plan to demonstrate moving the robot from an initial location to a goal, accounting for obstacles detailed on the map.

Due to difficulties with the virtual machine, the code provided has not yet been tested on the real robots or in simulation. It is quite possible the code thus does not fit entirely smoothly into the overall architecture for the grand challenge and will need tuning before being run on Wednesday.

## Instructions for Use
Clone repository onto machine and build workspace using catkin_make.
